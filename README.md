# Data-driven Location of New Schools in Brazil

The goal of this project is to estimate the education infraestructure gap and recommend optimal locations for new schools in Florianopolis and Pará based on capacity, demand, coverage, and location of current schools. To this we will use [UrbanPy](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06862-1_34) that leverages public and open-source data for modelling demographics and accesibility to points of interest.
