# Data-driven Location of New Schools in Brazil

The goal of this project is to estimate the education infraestructure gap and recommend optimal locations for new schools in Florianopolis and Par√° based on capacity, demand, coverage, and location of current schools. To this we will use [UrbanPy](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06862-1_34) that leverages public and open-source data for modelling demographics and accesibility to points of interest.
